## Collection Metadata

The table below provides sorting and basic search of the collection contents. 
Use the "CSV" or "Excel" button below to download the filtered metadata you see on the page in your preferred format. 
Alternatively, click the "More Options" button at the top right to view the full collection metadata in various export formats. 

{% include feature/modal.html button="CSV Troubleshooting" title="Issues with CSV in Excel" text="
<p>There are known issues with downloading the metadata in CSV and opening it in Excel. In Excel, the CSV will include broken text and not display Korean letters. However, the CSV file can be properly opened and legible if opened in alternative ways. For example, by uploading and opening the file through Google Sheets or opening with Notes. </p>
<p>The Data page allows the user to download the file directly as an .xlxs file which will properly open the file with Excel. If the user wants a CSV file but opened with Excel, here is the workaround:</p>

1.	Download the metadata as a .xlxs file
2.	Locate the file in the computer’s file explorer
3.	Open the file’s ‘Properties’
4.	Rename the file extension from .xlxs to .csv

<p>Then, the file should be a CSV file that can be properly opened using Excel.</p>" color="secondary" %}
