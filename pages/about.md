## Search Guide
Use the following attributes to find a film using the search function:
- Title	
- Director 	
- Description Keywords (e.g., colonial, Korean War, post-war)
- Subtitle Language(s)
- Release Year
- Historical Date
- Format (i.e., DVD, Blu-ray, Online)

**Note on Dates**
The historical date was determined by the film’s synoposis and/or in-film reference. For some films, the exact date of setting could not be determined, therefore it was mapped onto the nearest prominent date based on best judgement/guess.

If searching for a film about the 1980s, search "1980." The historical date and/or description will include this term.

If a film largely features flashbacks and covers a wide span of time, the film has been categorized based on its latest possible date. For example,

{% include feature/card.html header="국제시장 Kukche Sijang Ode to My Father" 
text="**Release Year:** 2015 **Historical Date:** 2015 **Description:** Follows the story of a protagonist across 60 years of his life. This begins from the Korean War (1950-1953), post-war life, Korean miners and nurses in Germany (1963), the Vietnam War (1964-1973), and the KBS Live Broadcast 이산가족을 찾습니다 (Finding Dispersed Families) in 1983. This film is categorized under the historical date, 2015 and release year, 2015. However, all of the dates in the description are searchable using the search function as well." objectid="kukchesijang" width="25" centered=true %}

## Accountability - Collection Statement
This guide is created to support students interested in learning about 20th century Korean history and Korean culture. The historical timeline is there to assist in understanding how the film depicts a period, experience, event, challenge, and/or issue of the time. There are two main goals of this film guide. 

-First, the goal of this guide is to provide an introductory way for a film to be situated within a context, enjoy the film, place films in conservation with each other, and support interest in Korean cinema.

-Second, the guide introduces the Korean film collection available at the UBC Asian Library. Hopefully the resource is able to assist users connect to UBC’s Korean film collection and become familiar with the collection. 

To end, this guide hopes to help students in their study of Korean history. In order to include several interesting, historically based films, films not available in the UBC library catalogue were included in this guide.

## About the Guide

**a) Scope:** 
The scope of films included in this guide were determined by historicity and being a regionally Korean production. It was not determined by historical accuracy, but rather, the film’s depiction of an event or time. This guide is by no means comprehensive of all films that cover a topic. Here are a few questions that guided the creation of this guide:	 
1. Is the film helpful with understanding an event in Korean history?
2. Does this film explore an experience, sentiment, or challenge experienced? 
3. Can this film, despite its fictionalization and dramatization, provide an entry way for learners of Korean history? 
4. How can this guide provide an introduction to the resources the library has to offer on people interested in Korean history and Korean cinema? 

**b) Title Format, Romanization:** 
Film titles include the Korean language and official English language title where possible. If no official English language title was released, the title of each film includes the Korean language, McCune–Reischauer Romanization, and unofficial English language title (if available). 
The director’s name is provided in McCune–Reischauer Romanization. If a director is affiliated with an alternative Romanization, it is noted in brackets.

**c) Decisions on Cataloguing and Classification**
This resource does not include several fields that often found for film catalogue. For example, subjects (genre) and cast information. With the previously stated use case in mind, this resource has been created to streamline the necessary information needed to browse, search, and access films for the purpose of learning about Korean history. For most records, additional information can be found on the UBC Library catalogue page.
